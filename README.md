<h1>Categorical Data and Polynomial Methods</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, an extensive dataset focusing on used cars in the United States serves as the foundation. Building upon the previous work titled "Modeling and Testing," the objective is to develop models specifically for the pricing of the Ford Focus SE model in four distinct states: North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Ohio. I demonstrate the use of categorical predictors in the models. Polynomial models are created including cubic, quartic, and second order models. The strength of the predictors and the strength of the models as a whole are also calculated. Linear model conditions undergo thorough scrutiny, encompassing checks for multicollinearity through metrics such as Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). Additionally, the project involves the application of analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests, facilitating model comparisons. Visual representation plays a pivotal role in conveying insights, with scatterplots featuring curves aiding in the interpretation of data patterns.
